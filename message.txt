Greetings! My name is {{.User.Name}}, and I'm an experienced {{.User.Role.Name}}. I noticed that you posted an opening for the position of {{.Open.Role.Name}}. Your company would benefit from leveraging my experience in {{.User.Role.Duties}}. Specifically, the company would be able to {{.Open.Company.Goals}} through the output that a {{.Open.Role.Name}} with the knowledge I've gained over time as a {{.User.Role.Name}} would produce. You'll find that, more than the existence of a good fit, that there is much to be gained from having my knowledge in {{.User.Role.Duties}}.

We can eliminate any doubts about what the company stands to gain by having a quick chat about my qualifications in slightly greater detail.

Best,

{{.User.Name}}
